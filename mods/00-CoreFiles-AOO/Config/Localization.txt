It started about 10 years ago when these strange monsters started to appear. At first they were rare and they they were very docile, but that changed quickly. They soon became more abundant and and much more agressive. Within 5 years they had wiped out 95% of the human and animal population. With such large losses the survivors became desperate to find a way to reverse the loss of life. Many of the remaining Scientists experimented with Resurrection, unfortunately this only made things worse. While resurrection was "successful" it was also flawed. After being resurrected it was found that the positive effects were short lived, those that had been brought back slowly started to decay and became extremely aggressive. To make matters worse, when these "former" humans  are killed they do not stay dead fo long.  Their Skeletons  continue to survive  and wreck havoc onthe world. Some of these Skeletons have have risen in power and have taken over facility as well as other key facilities. Most Recently the remaining scientists have been able to perfect Cloning. We can slowly  repopulate the world with Humans and Animal through the Cloning process but the facility is still producing these monsters and until we can destroy the the Skeleton Overloards and the research facility the circle will never end."
